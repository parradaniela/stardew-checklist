1. Vanilla Stardew 
    Should probably use the Foraging page on the wiki as it captures everything
        - https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Foraging
    Considerations
        - Items on the beach, ginger island, mines and beach are grouped separately from the seasons
        - Many vanilla foraging items will also appear in modded areas - is there an easy way to check this? 

    Ideas for targeting the things grouped by season 
    Can try conditional statement like
        Grab a table and its previous sibling h3. If it's not already in there, push the innerText of the h3 into the seasons array

    For beach
        - There is a "season found" column already, either push anything not already in the array, or if it says 'All' then do the check and push all 4/whichever ones are not already there

    For the mines, desert and ginger island
        - If item already exists in collection
            - if the mines not already in locations array
                - Push "The mines" location into the array
        - If item doesn't exist, create a whole new item etc
        - Insert all four seasons


2. Stardew Valley Expanded
    Forage page has links to individual forage items 
        - "https://stardew-valley-expanded.fandom.com/wiki/Forage" 

    Scraper will need to navigate to this page, collect all the links, then visit them one by one to scrape 
        - On the individual pages, we can grab 
            - h1 for the Name
            - Next sibling to the h3s that have 'Season' and 'Source' in their innertext 

    Consideration for updating vanilla item locations could be to scrape the foraging section from each location's page

3. RidgeSide Village
    Wiki page has a foraging page woohoo!
        - https://ridgeside.fandom.com/wiki/Foraging
    Similar to vanilla, we'll have to do some DOM node shenanigans to access previous sibling h2s to assign a season to the items in the tables
    The new locations have a foraging section as well that would list vanilla items

4. East Scarp
    Doesn't appear to have new foreageables so it's not relevant for the MVP 
        - It does have a unique fish list, so could be a consideration for stretch goal
    The locations on the wiki don't include forage lists for vanilla items so that could be a roadblock if this mod gets added later on to the app
        - Maybe I can ask the mod creator directly for a list if they have it, or I can try to dig through the mod files to see if item lists are easy to navigate
