MVP 
An app that allows the user to view a list of forageable items from vanilla SDV, as well as SDV Expanded, and RidgeSide Village
User should be able to filter by season, have a different view for each mod/vanilla, and have an option to view allows
The forageable items should have this information
    - Name - string
    - Image url - string
    - Wiki url - string
    - Locations - array of strings
    - season - array of strings
    - Available year 1 - true/false
        - May need to check if any items in RSV or ES appear only in year 3 or later
    - game - base, SVE, RSV or ES

To get the information, I'll need to build a web scraper using Puppeteer targeting the wikis for vanilla/the mods
I may need to manually download and store the images (can Puppeteer help with downloading at least?)

Stretch goals
- Option for user to add individual items to a personal list 
    - Will need to decide if this should be part of a login option so data can persist 
    - Or allow the user to download a .txt or .csv version of the list (this is probably easier/faster)
- Expand the app to also include fishing
- Maybe also expand to include crops
- Connect the scraper to a protected page on the site so that I can run it from the app itself
- Option to expand into adding other large mods as well 

Tech stack
- Puppeteer
- Node/Express
- MongoDB
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind? Component libraries? 

Deployment
- Netlify for front end
- Render for back end ?

Interesting case for fish - Winter with Rain requires rain totem
